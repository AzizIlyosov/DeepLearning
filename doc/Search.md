# Query-Document Understanding

Mostly unsupervised way. To understand the Query and Documentation

# TF-IDF

# BM25

# Learn to Ranking

Learning to rank or machine-learned ranking (MLR) is the application of machine learning, typically supervised, semi-supervised or reinforcement learning, in the construction of ranking models for information retrieval systems.Training data consists of lists of items with some partial order specified between items in each list. This order is typically induced by giving a numerical or ordinal score or a binary judgment (e.g. "relevant" or "not relevant") for each item

Compared with unsupervised learning like TF-IDF and BM25. It will leverage the supervised learning scheme

## Pointwise Learning to Rank

Turn the ranking to Binary Classification problem. The Training model will be pair of {keywords, Documentation}. The results is binray either relevant or not.
